### [Use the DuckDuckGo Extension to Block FLoC, Google’s New Tracking Method in Chrome](https://spreadprivacy.com/block-floc-with-duckduckgo/)

> With FLoC, by simply browsing the web, you are automatically placed into a group based on your browsing history (“cohort”). Websites you visit will immediately be able to access this group FLoC ID and use it to target ads or content at you. It's like walking into a store where they already know all about you! In addition, while FLoC is purported to be more private because it is a group, combined with your IP address (which also gets automatically sent to websites) you can continue to be tracked easily as an individual.

### [Who is sharing data with Google's FLoC ad algorithm?](https://adalytics.io/blog/google-chrome-floc)
"99.99% of websites are not opting out of FLoC. This study analyzed the 100,000 most popular domains according to the Tranco list, which ranks the most popular sites on the internet. Each domain was examined for the presence of a Permission-Policy header. If a domain included such a header, the header contents were checked for the presence of the “interest-cohort=()” flag. The analysis of 100,000 different domains, found that only 10 websites have chosen to opt-out of FLoC via the Permissions-Policy header (as of April 7th, 2021)." more on:
